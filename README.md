# AgentSmith

AgentSmith is an "agent harness control surface". It enables control of the agents on your machine with a best-in-class mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/agentsmith-remote-claude-more/id6787819824), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agentsmith.agentsmith)), [web app](https://app.agentsmith.dev) and [Electron-based desktop app](https://agentsmith.dev).

Works with your subscriptions on Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode, and Google Antigravity. If they're set up on your computer, AgentSmith can control them.

## "Wait, what are you selling me?"

Nothing. We built AgentSmith because we wanted the best possible development experience with agents. We were inspired by existing solutions like the Codex desktop app, Conductor, Claude Desktop and Cursor Glass, but none met our bar.

We wanted something performant, remote-ready, and truly open. If we ever go the wrong direction, we want you to have everything you need to fork and build the editor that you want.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> AgentSmith currently supports Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode, and Antigravity. Install and authenticate at least one provider before use:
>
> - Codex: install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and run `codex login`
> - Claude: install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and run `claude auth login`
> - Cursor: install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) and run `agent login`
> - Grok Build: install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli) and run `grok login`
> - OpenCode: install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and run `opencode auth login`
> - Antigravity: enable it in Settings, then use **Install Antigravity** and **Sign in with Google**. No CLI is required.

### Try it out (install-free)

The easiest way to test AgentSmith is to run the server in your terminal (requires Node.js 22.16+, 23.11+, or 24.10+):

```bash
npx agentsmith@latest
```

This will launch AgentSmith's backend on your machine as well as the local web app to control your agents.

Tip: Use `npx agentsmith@latest --help` for the full CLI reference.

### Desktop app

#### Windows (`winget`)

```bash
winget install AgentSmith.AgentSmith
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install --cask agentsmith
```

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

Stable:

```bash
